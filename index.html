              <p>
                The objective of my career is to work for an innovative company
                that is moving forward and create new software or analyze data.
                I'm also interested in creating digital solutions that have a
                strong impact and using data for generating insightful business
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                My immediate goal is to get a job in the software or data
                development field where I will be able to help not only in the
                technical but also in the strategic part of the business.
              </p>
              <p>
                For long-term plans, I want to be a leader in the tech industry
                in the future, where I will be able to influence innovation and
                also act as a mentor for those who want to work in the IT
                profession.

              <p>
                Based on Whetten and Cameron’s self-assessment theory, I am
                adaptive, team-oriented, and technically skilled. I am
                proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, and web frameworks like
                Flask and Laravel. My database experience includes MySQL,
                MongoDB, Hadoop, and Spark. I take pride in my organizational,
                problem-solving, and communication skills. However, I aim to
                improve in strategic leadership and project management, which I
                plan to address through mentorship, real-world experience, and
                mastering tools like AWS and Atlassian.

              <h4>Business Professionalism</h4>
              <p>
                One of the biggest takeaways of Business Professionalism is
                systems thinking, a mode of thinking that encourages one to
                think of organizations as complex interdependent systems. It
                helped me change from ideating around specific issues in
                isolation to ideas around the big picture of how people,
                processes, technology and environment are interconnected to
                generate organizational outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before taking this course, I would consider problems from a
                technically focused perspective like codes, bugs or
                performances. But through learning about systems theory and
                applying it to real business case analyses, I finally grasped
                how problems are often rooted in organizational structure,
                culture or communication breakdown. If one department failed, it
                was likely to affect others, and technical issues would
                oftentimes arise from lack of alignment with business goals.

          The feedback I got from my friends Dylan, Zophie Ann and Mave has
          really brought out the main points of my teamwork and dedication.
          Dylan is happy with my strong sense of responsibility, commitment and
          willingness to go beyond to get good results. Zophie Ann has given me
          warm comments with my initiative, creativity and technical support,
          especially when we worked together to create our website and
          presentation. Mave has talked about me as a trustworthy and
          responsible teammate and someone who is always punctual. These words
          representing my time management, collaboration and leadership skills
          in team settings are the ones that they have collectively expressed.
