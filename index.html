              <p>
                The objective of my career is to work for an innovative company
                that is moving forward and create new software or analyze data.
                I'm also interested in creating digital solutions that have a
                strong impact and using data for generating insightful business
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                My immediate goal is to get a job in the software or data
                development field where I will be able to help not only in the
                technical but also in the strategic part of the business.
              </p>
              <p>
                For long-term plans, I want to be a leader in the tech industry
                in the future, where I will be able to influence innovation and
                also act as a mentor for those who want to work in the IT
                profession.

              One of the most rewarding experiences of my academic life was my
              time as a Back-End Developer at Giant International Software
              Station, Inc. I worked on a time-tracking web application project
              that was aimed at improving internal productivity and
              accountability. In this project, I not only built my back-end
              development skills using React and Python, but I also learned how
              to properly collaborate with others in a team with very strict
              deadlines. I learned here how to solve problems in a systematic
              manner and how important user feedback is in developing helpful
              digital tools. I have already applied these skills to course
              projects and am learning frameworks like Flask and Laravel for
              full-stack deployment in my current studies.

            <p>
              My NZSE capstone project, "Developing a Standardized Grading
              System for Text Content using Large Language Models," was amongst
              my most enriching project experiences. The project aim was to
              design an AI-based web application that grades the appropriateness
              of text content for people under the age of 15 on the grounds of
              explicit material, mature themes, emotional impact, and cultural
              sensitivity. I constructed the entire web application using Flask
              and Python, integrating advanced natural language processing (NLP)
              techniques for powering automated content analysis and
              categorization. The platform provides a scalable means to enable
              content creators and platform moderators to determine and sift
              through user-generated content before publication, helping improve
              safer online spaces for younger audiences. This project continued
              to build my full-stack development, NLP implementation and ethical
              AI design capabilities—capabilities I'm eager to apply in future
              professions as a developer or data analyst.

              Participating in the 2024 GenAI Hackathon organized by AWS,
              Promptech and Unitec was an eye-opener for me. I worked in a group
              to develop an AI-based solution to solve sustainability problems.
              I developed an idea of sustainable technology through prototyping
              with the help of AWS tools, Figma and got to pitch the idea to the
              mentors and industry leaders. It highlighted interdisciplinary
              collaboration, ethics of AI design, and cloud deployment. I came
              to appreciate the significance of ongoing upskilling and more in
              areas like ethical AI.

            <h4>Business Professionalism</h4>
            <div class="collapsible-text">
              <p>
                One of the biggest takeaways of Business Professionalism is
                systems thinking, a mode of thinking that encourages one to
                think of organizations as complex interdependent systems. It
                helped me change from ideating around specific issues in
                isolation to ideas around the big picture of how people,
                processes, technology and environment are interconnected to
                generate organizational outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before taking this course, I would consider problems from a
                technically focused perspective like codes, bugs or
                performances. But through learning about systems theory and
                applying it to real business case analyses, I finally grasped
                how problems are often rooted in organizational structure,
                culture or communication breakdown. If one department failed, it
                was likely to affect others, and technical issues would
                oftentimes arise from lack of alignment with business goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                This paper has been incredibly beneficial in my studies and
                life. I tried to look at the bigger picture and ask myself why
                we are doing this project when working on group assignments. How
                roles fit together and how our efforts will contribute to the
                larger learning outcome. It's caused me to think more
                strategically and be more of a team player.
              </p>
              <p>
                In real-world practice, I plan to apply these systems thinking
                to any future IT career like a developer, analyst or team
                leader. Rather than simply building a tool or checking a data
                set, I'll think about how my work contributes to the company's
                mission, supports user needs and potentially carries ripple
                effects. System thinking, however, has not just changed the way
                I go about problems but also where I think about success in a
                working environment.

            <h4>Information Security Management</h4>
            <div class="collapsible-text">
              <p>
                Through the Information Security Management paper, I was in a
                position to acquire the important lessons pertaining to the
                importance of cybersecurity models, risk management methods and
                data governance. The most surprising lesson was the ease with
                which organizations can make enormous losses both financial, but
                also of trust and reputation if appropriate security controls
                are not established.
              </p>
              <p>
                These standards guide companies in establishing controls for
                data confidentiality, integrity and availability that exposed me
                to global standards like ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST. Vulnerabilities
                like phishing, malware attack, social engineering and insider
                threats are also learned from this paper. An assignment
                analyzing a real-world data breach was particularly impactful
                because it displayed how one weak link like poor access control
                could lead to a catastrophic event.
              </p>
              <p>
                This realization served to inform my own consciousness about
                digital security. I initiated the practice of using two-factor
                authentication for all my personal accounts, having good
                passwords and paying closer attention to how I retain and pass
                on confidential information. I also enforced good coding
                practices in one of my personal projects to avoid injection
                attacks or open endpoints.
              </p>
              <p>
                Professionally, I now have a foundation that I can build upon,
                especially if I enter a role that has to do with data systems or
                platform development. Knowing the impact of security design will
                serve me well to develop functional applications, but also
                secure and compliant ones. As I plan to venture into
                certifications like CompTIA Security+ or AWS Security, this
                learning is a fine entry point into the field of cybersecurity
                and ethical system architecture.

            <div class="collapsible-text">
              <p>
                The Enterprise Innovation paper introduced me to frameworks and
                tools encouraging customer thinking and innovative
                problem-solving. Before this, I had the notion that innovation
                is merely generating something entirely new. But through
                activities and case studies, I recognized that innovation is
                more about extending the existing processes, understanding the
                pain points of the users and employing systematic thinking to
                unlock new values.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the strongest ideas shared was design thinking. During a
                class discussion, we talked about innovation frameworks and
                prototype solutions for real business challenges. This activity
                showed me how to put product development at the center of the
                customer and how brainstorming, feedback loops and testing can
                generate effective and applicable innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                This training altered how I approach personal and academic
                projects. Prototyping ideas early and iterating on the basis of
                feedback from the user's perspective. I now spend more time
                looking at things differently rather than trying to get things
                right in isolation. It has improved my ability to pivot rapidly
                and adjust when something is not going well.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a practical environment, I plan to apply this innovative
                mindset to every tech job I do whether creating a new feature,
                enhancing a process or suggesting a system update. I've already
                begun using it on my portfolio projects by doing casual user
                testing and gathering early user interface feedback. The course
                encouraged me to accept change, think outside the box and be
                more at ease with ambiguity, all the essential qualities of a
                new-gen IT professional.

                Learning how to plan, manage and execute a project with the help
                of methodologies and tools was the most practical skill I gained
                in a Project Management course. The course alone was not the
                only factor that contributed to me coming up with such a
                decision. I really faced task management and deadlines which
                were really challenging at times especially in the team-based
                environment. Through a very practical approach of defining
                project scope, risk management, making a Gantt chart and good
                communication with stakeholders. I gained a full realization of
                the phases of a project that start from the initiation and end
                with the closure.

                In the group project, I was assigned the role of project
                coordinator, and this is where a breakthrough was reached. By
                means of Team Gantt and the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), I
                carried out the work allocation, timeline setting and progress
                observing of the team effectively. Besides this, I
                comprehensively practiced formal communication through project
                texts and status reports which kept the group aligned and
                accountable.

                This academic exercise was invaluable, as it not only enabled me
                to manage multiple tasks, understand the priority and due time
                but it was more than that, it helped me gain confidence to
                assume leadership roles in both academic and work environments.

                The skills that I have acquired can be used in many different
                aspects after finishing school. The ability to break down tasks,
                predict risks and interact with stakeholders is vital, no matter
                if you are managing the software development tasks or handling
                customer data projects. To my personal portfolio projects, I
                have adapted a few of the methods I used like timelines
                creation, goal setting and progress keeping. Through an
                internship, I want to keep working on improving these skills
                until I become an excellent leader of IT projects, both
                strategic and operational ones.

            <h4>Professional Development Planning</h4>
            <div class="collapsible-text">
              <p>
                One of the key stages in my career at ICL has been creating my
                Personal Development Plan (PDP) throughout the Business
                Professionalism course. It unquestionably was the first time I
                had systematically gathered evidence of my strengths, weaknesses
                and long-term career ambitions through reflection. This event
                enabled me to work on my thinking process, recognize positive
                things in my life and develop a growth plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PDP assessment led me to evaluate my technical and
                interpersonal competences equally. I found out that besides
                being confident in coding, data analytics and problem-solving. I
                also had to work on my time management, leadership presence and
                networking in the industry. By establishing SMART objectives, I
                was able to choose my path and determine simple steps such as
                taking online courses, going to local tech meetups or improving
                my LinkedIn profile.
              </p>
              <p>
                This plan has positively affected my abilities and confidence
                already. So far, I started managing tasks with tools like Trello
                and Notion, keeping track of progress and reflected on the
                mistakes to correct my strategies. It has meant a lot to me in
                the sense that I have managed to stick to it even with a busy
                schedule of studies and part time work.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be honest, I perceive my PDP in the future as a document that
                accomplished at its best, the continuous monitoring of the
                journey’s result and can be revised when changes occur. It is a
                source of commitment, an energizer and a mirror that allows me
                to see the distances I have travelled and those still waiting
                for me to cross. This method gave me the insight to recognize
                that not by luck it happens but as a result of purposeful plans,
                self-discovery and being open to constant learning that one gets
                professional success.

              The feedback I got from my friends Dylan, Zophie Ann and Mave has
              really brought out the main points of my teamwork and dedication.
              Dylan is happy with my strong sense of responsibility, commitment
              and willingness to go beyond to get good results. Zophie Ann has
              given me warm comments with my initiative, creativity and
              technical support, especially when we worked together to create
              our website and presentation. Mave has talked about me as a
              trustworthy and responsible teammate and someone who is always
              punctual. These words representing my time management,
              collaboration and leadership skills in team settings are the ones
              that they have collectively expressed.
